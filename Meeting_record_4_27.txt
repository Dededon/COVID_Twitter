Some Qualitative Research on the Cluster Data:
(Better to do with single category data because it makes more sense)
1. What the clusters are, how clusters are connected, what are the spam data
2. The user activity within the cluster (num of tweets to check whether is bot)
3. The user location with the provided code 
(What are the location patterns of the clusters? B&R states, rural vs. city, percint Biden winning, feel free to edit data)

Probably Migrate the analysis from networkx to the sklearn dim reduction and clustering with such method:
Hashtag/Retweet/Mention top 100/200 list
Each user have a vector (sparse) with (count of retweeted/hashtagged/mentioned times)
Or Bert vector if we can process that out
Calculate cosine-similarity or Euclidean distance to create links between distinct users
And do dim reduction and clustering with DBSCAN
Check the colored clusters, check the clustering result
